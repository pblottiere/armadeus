Tools used with anybus_interface driver and HMS Anybus module.

If you run it on an Armadeus board APF51-Dev, you can generate the design and
copy the driver automatically with the script :
your_armadeus_dir/firmware/pod_scripts/apf51_anybus_interface.pod
A pre-designed FPGA design is also available in this directory.
