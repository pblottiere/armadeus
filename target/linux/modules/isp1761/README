 ISP176x driver (version 2.0.0.0-gum1)
---------------------------------------

This driver for the ISP1761 on a Gumstix is adapted from version 2.0.0.0 of the
ISP176x host driver released by Philips at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/isp176x-hcd

Changes from the original driver essentially involve:
 - porting to Linux 2.6.17
 - writing the HAL module hal_pxa.c
 - The addition of gumstix-isp1761.c to point the driver at the relevant
   resources.

The board it has been tested on has the ISP1761 wired up as follows:
 - 16-bit data bus
 - 17-bits of address lines straight through
 - nCS on nCS2
 - NPWE to nWR (VLIO)
 - NOE to nRD

The gumstix-isp1761 module must be loaded before pehci, else the pehci module
will not load.

Porting to your port will involve editing gumstix-isp1761.c to find the correct
chip select lines, IRQ lines, and memory regions. A 32-bit data bus will also
require some changes to the mode register setting (set upon reset) in pehci.c
and hal_pxa.c.

Isochronous support has not been tested.
