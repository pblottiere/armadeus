This is a really simple driver to test reading and writing
a value on i2c memory component throught ocore-irq_mng FPGA IP.

Frames are like :
START+ADDR+ACK+SUBADDR+ACK+REPSTART+ADDR+ACK+VALUE+ACK+STOP

To use it load i2ctest.ko module with insmod
>insmod i2ctest.ko

Then read /proc/i2c_test with cat
> cat /proc/i2c_test

This will send write command on component

To read the value you wrote, read /proc/i2c_test2
> cat /proc/i2c_test2
