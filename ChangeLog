    - Lot of bug fixes and cleanup, more realtime configs

  All changes
    - APF6: all defconfigs: give a volume name (ROOTFS) to rootfs.ext4 image)

  - uClibc-0.9.29 pretends that spinclocks are available  ("#define _POSIX_SPIN_LOCKS" in posix_opt.h) whereas for ARM, this functionality is currently in development. As a consequence, third party applications looking for this define to internally enable spinlocking  may fail to compile. (As "clocktest" provided by Xenomai). This patch inhibits the faulty define.
