This project is an exemple for wishbone interface . There are three Wb slaves :

* irq_mngr : this slave joins irq from others wishbone IP and
             send it to i.mx processor.To manage these irq
             two registers are available :
                     irq_mask ( addr : 0x0000)        : enable irq writing 1
                     irq_pend/irq_ack (addr : 0x0002) : writing 1 acknowledge irq and 
                                                        reading 1 inform that an irq 
                                                        pending.
             This design use one irq for button push and release.

* wb_led   : a simple led register, one led is branched on register LSB.
             To switch on led write '0' on led register. Address register
             is :
                     LED (addr : 0x0008)              : on/off led
* wb_button: Simple button register, when button is pressed, register LSB
             is '0', and when it's release LSB is '1'. On each switching
             an interuption is send to irq_mngr. Address register is :
                     button (addr : 0x000e)           : read pressed value
