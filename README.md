# ARMADEUS-6.0

## Debian Jessie

After some updates about downloading links (in the Buildroot part), the
compilation is straightforward and images are successfully generated.

I have tested my armadeus APF28 card with :

    * the uboot image **apf28-u-boot.sb**
    * the kernel image **apf28-linux.bin**
    * the UBIFS **apf28-rootfs.ubi**

## Debian Stretch

Due to gcc 5.x, several errors raised during the compilation. I did not have
time to dig up at the moment...
